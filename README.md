# CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.
Some of the factors that contribute a lot to the price of a car are:

1. Brand
2. Model
3. Horsepower
4. Mileage
5. Safety Features
6. GPS and many more.
If one ignores the brand of the car, a car manufacturer primarily fixes the price of a car based on the features it can offer a customer. Later, the brand may raise the price depending on its goodwill, but the most important factors are what features a car gives you to add value to your life. So, in the section below, I will walk you through the task of training a car price prediction model with machine learning using the Python programming language.
